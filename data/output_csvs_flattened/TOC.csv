GTA Color Mapping Project,Unnamed: 1,Unnamed: 2,Unnamed: 3,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 5
"
Comprehensive, user-friendly cross-reference for all vehicle color-related data in GTA Online, including official, custom, crew and other color types.  
Developed for enthusiasts who need reliable, sortable, and visually rich color mapping.  
Data is collected and consolidated from multiple sources (Fandom Wiki, GTABase, Imgur, Wayback Machine, archive.today, joonasprkl archives, GTAForums community, Se7enSins community, Discord, personal/shared collections).  
Each color category/type has its own sheet, with standardized columns for ID, Color Name, Hex (Web RGB), RGB, Paint Chip, Preview Image (or placeholder) and Notes.  
Each color has a paint chip or color chip swatch that corresonds with the hex value and the cells are bucket filled to match.  
Images are downloaded, renamed by ID, name and hex, resized to a fixed 200px width (maintaining aspect ratio), and imported into the appropriate sheet.  
Row heights and column widths are set for readability and to match image dimensions. Source attribution is provided via ref source urls, footers, or an info sheet. 
The project is modular, with large workbooks split for manageability and is intended to be shared, torn apart and built upon. Basic files, workbooks and documentation are published on GitHub.
